# Arcade-Runner-Game
This is my first ever Unity game. I called it whatever, couldn't come up with a better name.

It's a very small game with just 3 levels and 5 scenes (3 levels, a welcome screen and a credits screen)

# The Tutorial I followed
Huge thanks to Brackey's for his amazing tutorial: [Link to the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL)

I followed this playlist and made this game in roughly a few hours.

# What's the difference
1. I refactored the code.
2. I tried to do an organized folder management.
3. I refactored the level design.
4. I added colors!
